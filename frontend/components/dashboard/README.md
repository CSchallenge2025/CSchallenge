# Dashboard Components (Initial Skeleton)

This folder contains the first iteration of the authenticated dashboard modules. All data is mocked except the profile (coming from /api/v1/users/profile).

Modules:
- WelcomeModule: Greets user by email.
- ProfileSummary: Basic profile fields.
- UsageMeters: Placeholder for enhancement/optimization limits.
- QuickActions: Entry points for upcoming flows (upload, enhance, optimize).
- RecentResumes: Mocked list of resume variants.
- MatchesPreview: Mocked job match scores.
- ActivityFeed: Mocked recent actions.

Next Steps:
1. Replace mocked data with real API endpoints.
2. Add loading skeletons and error boundary.
3. Introduce pagination/links to detailed views.
4. Accessibility audit and keyboard focus states.
